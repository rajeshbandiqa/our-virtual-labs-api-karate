## Title: Test Automation for GUI and API - CI/CD Concepts

## Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a test automation framework that covers both GUI and API testing, and to explore concepts related to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). The project aims to provide hands-on experience in automating tests for graphical user interfaces (GUI) and application programming interfaces (API), and to demonstrate how these tests can be seamlessly integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## Project Scope:
The project will involve the following key components and concepts:

## Test Automation Framework:

- Develop a modular and scalable test automation framework that supports both GUI and API testing.
Implement the framework using industry-standard tools and libraries such as Selenium WebDriver for GUI testing and REST-assured for API testing.
Design the framework to promote code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.
GUI Test Automation:

- Create automated tests for the graphical user interfaces of the target application(s).
Write test scripts to verify the functionality, usability, and performance of the GUI components.
Implement page object model (POM) design pattern to enhance the test script maintainability and readability.
Utilize Selenium WebDriver to interact with web elements, perform actions, and validate expected behaviors.
API Test Automation:

- Develop automated tests to validate the functionality and performance of the target application's APIs.
Use REST-assured library to send HTTP requests, validate responses, and perform assertions on the API endpoints.
Verify API responses, payload structures, status codes, and data integrity.
CI/CD Integration:

- Configure the project to be integrated with popular CI/CD platforms such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD.
Set up automated test execution as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous testing and validation of new changes.
Define test stages, triggers, and reporting mechanisms to provide meaningful insights into test results.
Reporting and Metrics:

- Generate comprehensive test reports that include detailed test execution results, including test status, logs, and screenshots.
Incorporate reporting tools such as Extent Reports, Allure, or custom reporting solutions.
Monitor and track key metrics related to test coverage, test execution time, and test failure rates.
Project Goals and Learning Objectives:

* Gain hands-on experience in building a test automation framework for GUI and API testing.
* Learn how to write automated tests for GUI components using Selenium WebDriver.
* Understand API testing concepts and implement automated tests using REST-assured.
* Explore and implement CI/CD concepts and tools for test automation integration.
* Gain insights into the benefits of continuous testing and the importance of test automation in CI/CD pipelines.
* Enhance knowledge of test reporting and metrics to track the quality of the application under test.
